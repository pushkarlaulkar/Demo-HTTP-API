If details of only a specific book is required we can replace the 'all' keyword in the link to a number between 0-5 which corresponds to the respective ID of the book.

For e.g. if the details of the book which has id 3 is required enter the link as [book-3](https://demo-http-api.herokuapp.com/http_api/v1/books/3). The below output will be shown
